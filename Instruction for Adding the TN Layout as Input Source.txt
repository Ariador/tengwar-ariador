INSTRUCTION FOR ADDING THE ARIADOR KEYBOARD LAYOUT TO AN UBUNTU SYSTEM

Â© 2025 Igor Voloshin ariador@mail.com


NOTE 1: The advanced user skills in Linus systems are strongly
        recommended to use this instruction. It's better to understand
        what's going on with the system.

1. Download 'tn' layout file from this repository to your drive, say
   to 'Downloads' directory;

2. Open your terminal and switch to your root privileged user account;

3. Copy 'tn' file to the layouts directory:
   cp -f /home/your_username/Downloads/tn /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

4. Switch to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/ directory and open the file
   'evdev.lst' with your preferred editor. In the '! layout' section
   find the appropriate place - it's between 'tj Tajik' and 'th Thai'
   lines - and insert there the line 'tn Tengwar Ariador'.
   Save the file;

5. Open the file 'evdev.xml' and put there a reference to the layout:

    <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>tn</name>
        <!-- Keyboard indicator for Tengwar Ariador layout -->
        <shortDescription>tn</shortDescription>
        <description>Tengwar Ariador</description>
        <countryList>
          <iso3166Id>UA</iso3166Id>
        </countryList>
        <languageList>
          <iso639Id>ukr</iso639Id>
        </languageList>
      </configItem>
    </layout>

   NOTE 2: This reference should go strictly after some other layout
         '</layout>' line and before some next layout '<layout>'
         line. It's clear indeed, but please pay attention.

   Save the file.

6. It's done! Now you can go to the 'System Settings/Keyboard' and
   press '+ Add Input Source'. Look for the 'Ukrainian' language
   and for the 'Tengwar Ariador' item therein. Immediately after
   adding it you will see 'Tengwar Ariador  tn' item in your input
   sources list. Reboot is not required, just open your documents
   processor, set font to 'Tengwar Ariador' and start typing.
   
   NOTE 3: RightAlt key used to switch to 3rd and 4th tiers of the
           layout might overlap to your Compose key, which is often
           set to the same RightAlt. To avoid them conflicting, you
           could assign the Compose key function to some other key.
           For me the Menu key works good.
