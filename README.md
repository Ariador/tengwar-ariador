Another font for the fictional Tengwar script developed by the great J.R.R.Tolkien for gis immense Arda Universe. The font is free and open source (the FontForge SFD file is included). All the rights to the word "Tengwar" and the script itself belong to their respectful owners - the Tolkien Estate.
The goal of making another one Tengwar font is convenience of use the font with generic US English keyboard layout, PNG image of the glyphs layout '20250131 Tengwar Ariador US Layout.png' is enclosed. All the glyphs not directly available for typing are listed in the enclosed file '20250131 Tengwar Ariador Glyphs with Quenya Names.pdf' and are available for typing using Compose key. The glyphs span is limited solely with the Basic Latin and Latin-1 ISO 8859-1 character set.

Issues to solve are the following:
  1. There are 12 unused glyph positions left in Latin-1 set, which could be filled with some missed tengwar, a matter of further studies;
  2. Tiny improvements in some glyphs outline are possible;
  3. Special custom keyboard layout for the font is under development, to be embedded in Ubuntu system as separate input source.
